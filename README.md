# Normalization_Regularization

The code is modularized and has seperate functions:

* A single model.py file that includes a function to choose the norm_type as either GN/LN/BN to decide which normalization to include and creates the network architecture accordingly
* a training function
* a testing function
* a function to plot the metrics
* and also a few helper functions to load the data, print missclassified images
